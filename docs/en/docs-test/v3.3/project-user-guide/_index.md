In Super Kubenetes, project users with necessary permissions are able to perform a series of tasks, such as creating different kinds of workloads, configuring volumes, Secrets, and ConfigMaps, setting various release strategies, monitoring app metrics, and creating alerting policies. As Super Kubenetes features great flexibility and compatibility without any code hacking into native Kubernetes, it is very convenient for users to get started with any feature required for their testing, development and production environments.
