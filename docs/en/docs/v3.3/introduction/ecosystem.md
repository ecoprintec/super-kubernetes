## Abundant Ecosystem Tools

Super Kubenetes integrates **a wide breadth of major ecosystem tools related to Kubernetes**, ranging from cloud-native apps to the underlying container runtimes. These open-source projects serve as the backend components of Super Kubenetes, which interact with the Super Kubenetes console through standard APIs, thus providing consistent user experiences to reduce complexity.

Super Kubenetes also features new capabilities that are not yet available in upstream Kubernetes, alleviating the pain points of Kubernetes including storage, network, security and usability. Not only does Super Kubenetes allow developers and DevOps teams use their favorite tools in a unified console, but, most importantly, these functionalities are loosely coupled with the platform since they are pluggable and optional.
