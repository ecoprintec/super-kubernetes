[Meshery](https://meshery.io/) is the open source, cloud native management plane that enables the adoption, operation, and management of Kubernetes, any service mesh, and their workloads.

This tutorial walks you through an example of deploying Meshery from the App Store of Super Kubenetes.

## Prerequisites

- Please make sure you [enable the OpenPitrix system](../../../pluggable-components/app-store/).
- You need to create a workspace, a project, and a user account (`project-regular`) for this tutorial. The account needs to be a platform regular user and to be invited as the project operator with the `operator` role. In this tutorial, you log in as `project-regular` and work in the project `demo-project` in the workspace `demo-workspace`. For more information, see [Create Workspaces, Projects, Users and Roles](../../../quick-start/create-workspace-and-project/).

## Hands-on Lab

1. On the **Overview** page of the project `demo-project`, click **App Store** in the upper-left corner.
2. Search for **Meshery** in the App Store, and click on the search result to enter the app.
